My configs for i3 Window Manager, along with various other plugins that I use in tandem with it.
This project is still in very early development, and will evolve until I get an AMD GPU and switch to a Wayland compositor. :P

*CHANGELOGS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AFTER 1.01.1*

Ver. 1.02
- Added new font configurations for polybar, and changed the overall appearance of the bar.
- Experimentation with icons is added.
- i3 Module support.
